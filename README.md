# Los Pollos Hermanos

"Los Pollos Hermanos was a fast-food restaurant chain that specialized in fried chicken operating across the southwestern United States. The name, pronounced [los ˈpo.ʝos eɾˈma.nos], is ungrammatical Spanish for "The Chicken Brothers." Founded by Gustavo Fring and Max Arciniega, the restaurant chain had fourteen locations throughout the southwest and was Gustavo Fring's major business concern. Los Pollos Hermanos was a subsidiary of Madrigal Electromotive, a German conglomerate with an ownership stake in the company. The restaurant also provided money-laundering and logistics for illegal activities. -- [Breaking Bad Wiki](https://breakingbad.fandom.com/wiki/Los_Pollos_Hermanos)"

TC: Let's Get Down to Business

* Company name (as the title of the README).
* One paragraph description of the company (beneath the title).
* A section named Dependencies that contains a list of the external resources and assumptions needed for your website to run (everyone should include Bootstrap and the browser(s) you tested your website on here, but you don't need to have more than that if you don't want to).
* A section named Authors that contains a list of the contributors to the project.
* A section named Acknowledgments that credits any inspiring code or people that made your design what it is today.
